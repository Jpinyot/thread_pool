# A C++11/C++14 Low-lock Thread Pool with Priority Tasks

# Abstract

# thread_pool
Presenting a C++11/C++14-compatible thread pool implementation, built from scrach with high-performance embedded systems in mind.

# Introduction
Thread pool implementation using c++14/c++11 threads and a lock-free skip list.
